"""Exploratory analytics on already-collected backtest data. Every result
this module produces is explicitly labeled EXPLORATORY -- hypothesis
material for future validation on a larger sample, NOT evidence to change
the live bot's actual behavior. The live bot's 55% confidence threshold
stays fixed regardless of what these reports show.

Statistical guardrail, stated plainly: with roughly 170-270 actionable
trades per symbol from a single 17-day window, splitting further by
threshold shrinks each bucket further. A threshold that looks better here
could easily just be a smaller, noisier sample looking better by chance --
that's exactly the trap this analysis exists to avoid falling into, not
evidence to act on.
